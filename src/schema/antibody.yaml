# Questions.
# 1. No single field is required. Is that ok?

# Issues deemed beyond the current scope.
# 1. How to specify reference for each cross reference, synonym, note, etc.
# 2. How to track history (audit) of who made changes when.
# 3. How to relate antibodies with diseases (no linkml for disease yet).
