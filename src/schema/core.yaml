  subject:
    is_a: association slot
    description: >-
      connects an association to the subject of the association.
      For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.

      For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    required: true
    range: named thing
    exact_mappings:
      - biolink:object

  predicate:
    is_a: association slot
    description: >-
      A high-level grouping for the relationship type. This is analogous to category for nodes.
      In RDF, this corresponds to rdf:predicate and in Neo4j this corresponds to the
      relationship type.
